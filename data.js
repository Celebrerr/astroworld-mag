The warm air is less dense and rises through the cooler air above it.As additional air moves inward along the surface to replace the rising pocket, it begins to rotate driven by Coriolis forces, and forms a vortex of spinning air. When the incoming air rises into the column, its rotation picks up speed like a spinning ice skater bring their arms closer to their body. This faster moving air near the soil surface can cause sand grains to bounce and kick up dust which easily rises up into the growing vortex. In this way a dust devil is born.',

Pits of various sizes have formed along most of the fractures, and some of the pits have merged into elongated depressions. The association of the pits with the fractures suggests that the pits were formed by removal of material deep within the fractures. A plausible reason for the formation of these features is that the crater floor material includes substantial ground ice. When the fractures open, perhaps due to glacial-like flow of the ice-rich floor material toward the center of the crater, water ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere.',
